Sepia is automatically installed by ```sudo eggs install --oem sepia --custom it```, and performs its action on the first access of the installed machine.

At the end of user configuration, sepia is uninstalled.

It is possible to have others first access system configurators that can be used with eggs passing the value during OEM system installation: ```sudo eggs install --oem your-first-access-system-configurator```.

 ## Develop
Actually using npm packed manager.
